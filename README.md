Comparative Analysis of Penetration Testing Tools in Assessing Web Application Vulnerabilities written by Hope
This research analyses and compares the effectiveness of penetration testing tools to detect web application vulnerabilities. The penetration testing tools evaluated were Burp Suite Professional, Burp Suite Community, OWASP ZAP, Wfuzz, Hydra, and SQL Map. These tools have been assessed in a controlled environment. Regardless, DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application a real-world web application, which is equipped with different levels of security option was used for this research. The key performance indicators that were analysed are the detection accuracy, ease of use, capability to integrate with another tool, and capability to generate a report. This research identifies security vulnerabilities which can be exploited and will help to strengthen the organisationâ€™s defence system. This initiative-taking approach supports compliance, reduces risks and improves overall security posture.
