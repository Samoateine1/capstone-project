## Tools Evaluated

The following penetration testing tools were assessed:

- **Burp Suite Professional**
- **Burp Suite Community**
- **OWASP ZAP**
- **Wfuzz**
- **Hydra**
- **SQLMap**

## Testing Environment

A controlled environment was established for all tests. The **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**, a real-world, purposely insecure web application, was utilized as the test bed. DVWA offers various security levels, allowing for comprehensive assessment of each tool’s capabilities in different scenarios.

## Key Performance Indicators

The following key performance indicators (KPIs) were analyzed for each tool:

1. **Detection Accuracy**  
   How effectively the tool identifies known vulnerabilities within the application.

2. **Ease of Use**  
   The user experience, including installation, configuration, and operational simplicity.

3. **Capability to Integrate with Other Tools**  
   The extent to which each tool can work alongside or interface with other security solutions or automation frameworks.

4. **Capability to Generate Reports**  
   The ability to produce clear, actionable reports summarizing findings and recommendations.

## Findings & Impact

This research identifies security vulnerabilities that can be exploited, providing actionable insights to help organizations:

- Strengthen their defense systems
- Support regulatory compliance
- Reduce operational and reputational risk
- Improve overall security posture

Adopting a proactive approach to penetration testing with the right tools not only uncovers hidden vulnerabilities but also supports ongoing security improvement initiatives.
